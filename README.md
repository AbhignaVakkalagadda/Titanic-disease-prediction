Titanic Survival Prediction Project
Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The model analyzes various passenger attributes like age, gender, ticket class, and fare to determine survival likelihood with high accuracy.

Dataset
The dataset contains information about 1309 Titanic passengers with the following features:

PassengerId: Unique identifier

Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)

Name: Passenger name

Sex: Gender

Age: Age in years

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard

Ticket: Ticket number

Fare: Passenger fare

Cabin: Cabin number

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
